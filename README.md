>## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true

>## Data Flow

* **Controller** : The controller handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates the processing to the appropriate service methods. It maps the incoming URLs to specific methods and returns the corresponding HTTP responses.
* **Services** : The services contain the business logic of the application. They interact with the repositories to fetch or update data, perform CRUD operations, and manage the relationships between entities.
* **Repository** : The repository interfaces define data access operations using Spring Data JPA. They interact with the database to retrieve or persist data from/to the entities.
* **Database Design** : The database design includes tables for users, playlists, and songs, where playlists have a many-to-one relationship with users, and playlists have a many-to-many relationship with songs.
* **dto** : this layer UserSignupInput,UserSignUpOutput,AdminSignInInput,AdminSignInOutput which store the data of user and admin to Authentication.
